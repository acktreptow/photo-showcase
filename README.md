# Photo Showcase

Welcome to Photo Showcase! This project explores various Next.js fetching and caching strategies, showcased through Unsplash photos.

To view the different showcases, click [here](https://photo-showcase-theta.vercel.app/)!

## Technologies Used

- Next.js (Next.js 14 App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Unsplash API

## Project Overview

Whether it's thumbnails for my YouTube channel, taking far too many pictures of my dog, or general photo editing, I love working with images. The Unsplash API was therefore the perfect choice for this project because it allowed me to achieve both of my goals:

1. I learned new techniques from the myriad Unsplash photos I viewed while making the showcases, which I can now incorporate into my own.
2. My Next.js skills significantly improved as I went through the trial and errors of implementing the various fetching and caching techniques on each page. I especially felt this growth on the final page, where I gained experience with backend aspects like Next API route handlers.

### Homepage

The homepage serves as the landing page, providing navigation to other sections and some introductory information about each of them.

### Static Page

The static page fetches and caches the Unsplash API data at build time so the same picture will remain even if there is a page refresh.

### Dynamic Page

The dynamic page doesn't cache the data fetched from the Unsplash API, so there will always be a new Unsplash photo with every page refresh.

### Incremental Static Regeneration Page

This is a hybrid of the static and dynamic methods. The page is generated statically, but it can regenerate after 5 seconds to fetch a new photo from the Unsplash API.

### Dogs/topics Page

This page uses the topic parameter to fetch 12 related photos from the Unsplash API. While the dog photos are static because they were fetched/cached at build time, other topics are dynamic. These are fetched/rendered on first access, then cached for subsequent visits (photos won't change on refresh).

### Search Page

The only page that fetches data client-side because user input is needed to render photos. However, the GET request to the Unsplash API is sent via a server-based Next.js API route handler. This prevents my Unsplash access credentials from leaking in the page source of your device (the client).
